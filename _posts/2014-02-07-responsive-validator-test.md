After making a change in the style of our responsive web apps, we need to validate the impact of 
those changes.  I made this tool to validate quickly our web apps in different screen sizes.  

The simple solution was created a page with desktop / ipad / ipod / iphone layouts.

Of course, this quick test never replace testing with the real devices. Many issues are hidden by 
the desktop processing. But, the great value is the quick validation we can make of 
our changes.
